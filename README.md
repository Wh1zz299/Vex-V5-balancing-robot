This Project is a self balancing vex robot ive wanted to make for a while 
In my engineering class i was a couple asignments ahead so i decided to try making a self balancing robot for our biomimicry project coming up 
idk if you can call balancing a animal skill but it is what ive been working on for the past 2 weeks :)
